    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <div id="div2">  Hello, again my name is Kevin Rico, I was born and raised with my twin sister here in the state of Colorado. 
      Both my mom and dad were born in Mexico,but moved into the United States around 1996, met around 2000, and had us at 2002.I started school in Colorado,then moved to Kentucky starting in first grade,then from 4th-12th grade I finished here in Colorado.
       Once I turn 18, I didn't have a set goal in mind to achieve or become anything.
      So my main goal would be to go into the workforce until of this year when I decided I try to go into IT for my liking into math and technology.
